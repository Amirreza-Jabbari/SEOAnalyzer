# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following table lists the versions of the `SEOAnalyzer` software that are currently supported with security updates:

| Version    | Supported          |
|------------|--------------------|
| 1.x.x      | :white_check_mark:  |
| < 1.x.x    | :x:                |

Only the latest major version (1.x.x) is actively maintained and receives security updates. Older versions are no longer supported and should be upgraded to ensure continued security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and are committed to promptly addressing any potential vulnerabilities in the `SEOAnalyzer` project.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by following these steps:

1. **Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.**
   We request that vulnerabilities are reported privately to avoid exposing the issue to potential attackers before it can be addressed.

2. **Contact the security team.**
   Send an email to `[your-email@example.com]` with the following details:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
   - Any proof-of-concept (PoC) code or logs that illustrate the vulnerability.
   - The version of `SEOAnalyzer` affected by the issue.

3. **Expect a response within 48 hours.**
   We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and begin investigating the issue. During this time, we may reach out to you for additional information.

4. **Cooperate with disclosure.**
   We will work with you to confirm and fix the issue, after which we will issue a security patch. We may also credit you for identifying the vulnerability in any relevant documentation, but only with your consent.

## Security Measures

We implement the following security measures within the `SEOAnalyzer` project:

1. **Secure Coding Practices:** We follow best practices for secure coding, including input validation, proper error handling, and secure dependency management.
   
2. **Regular Security Audits:** The codebase is regularly audited to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

3. **Dependency Management:** We rely on trusted third-party libraries and ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

4. **HTTPS Enforcement:** The `SEOAnalyzer` class includes checks for HTTPS usage to ensure secure communication for websites being analyzed.

5. **User Data Protection:** Although `SEOAnalyzer` does not handle sensitive user data directly, we encourage its use in secure environments where personal data is adequately protected.

6. **Minimal Permissions:** `SEOAnalyzer` is designed to operate with minimal privileges, reducing the risk of exploitation in the case of an attack.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

Once a vulnerability is reported, we aim to follow this timeline for disclosure:

1. **Report received** – We acknowledge the report within 48 hours.
2. **Initial investigation** – Within 7 days of acknowledgment, we will assess the severity and impact of the issue.
3. **Patch development** – A patch will be developed and tested within 14 days of the initial assessment.
4. **Public disclosure** – Once the patch is ready and released, we will disclose the vulnerability and give credit where appropriate, ensuring the details of the fix are transparent.

## Security Best Practices for Users

While `SEOAnalyzer` itself does not handle sensitive data, we recommend that users adhere to the following best practices:

1. **Run the analyzer in a secure environment.**
   Avoid running `SEOAnalyzer` on sensitive production servers or in environments with untrusted input.

2. **Regularly update to the latest version.**
   Ensure that you are using the latest version of `SEOAnalyzer` to benefit from the most recent security patches.

3. **Secure network communication.**
   Use HTTPS whenever analyzing websites to avoid exposing sensitive data in transit.

4. **Review dependencies and third-party libraries.**
   Keep all dependencies up-to-date to avoid known vulnerabilities in the software used by `SEOAnalyzer`.
